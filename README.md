# Market-Analysis-in-Banking-Domain
The data size is huge and the marketing team has asked you to perform the below analysis:


    - Load data and create a Spark data frame
    - Give marketing success rate (No. of people subscribed / total no. of entries)   
    - Give marketing failure rate
    - Give the maximum, mean, and minimum age of the average targeted customer
    - Check the quality of customers by checking average balance, median balance of customers
    - Check if age matters in marketing subscription for deposit
    - Check if marital status mattered for a subscription to deposit
    - Check if age and marital status together mattered for a subscription to deposit scheme
    - Do feature engineering for the bank and find the right age effect on the campaign.
